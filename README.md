# WeatherApp-01
A weather app collects and processes data from various weather APIs to provide accurate, real-time forecasts. It uses a user's location to fetch details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed from global meteorological sources. The app's interface then presents this information, offering real-time updates and hourly/daily forecasts for any location worldwide.
